* **Research Title** : Brain Tumor Detection
On Magnetic Resonance Images With
Deep Neural Network Method

* **Description** :
The brain tumor was detected using a deep learning method that create a model from MRI Brain Images with a labeled dataset. The model has a pattern of a unique label from a weighted neuron that is trained over a dataset.

* **Objectives and Benefits** :
  - Produce a prototype tool that can diagnose brain tumors through patterns on MRI.
  - Analyzing the speed and accuracy of the deep neural network method in recognizing patterns on MRI.
* **Data** :
3000 images consist of 1500 Images Tumor & 1500 of Healthy Brain Images

* **Method** :
Deep Neural Network

* **Metrics** :
  - F1-Score
  - Sensitivity
  - Specificity
  - TPR
  - FPR
  - Accuracy

* **Hardware Acceleration** :
  Running On Local GPU : Nvidia GTX 1650 Max-Q Design 4 GB RAM
